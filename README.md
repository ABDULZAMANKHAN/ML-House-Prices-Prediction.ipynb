In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into our dataset before building a predictive model. Here are the key steps I followed during EDA to extract valuable information from the data:

## Understanding the Data Structure:

- Examined the dimensions of the dataset using `df.shape` to get the number of rows and columns.
- Used `df.head()` or `df.tail()` to inspect a few rows and understand the data's structure.

## Summarizing the Data:

- Utilized `df.info()` to get an overview of the data types and missing values in each column.
- Generated descriptive statistics for numerical columns using `df.describe()`, including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, quartiles, etc.
- Analyzed unique values and frequency counts in categorical columns using `df['column_name'].value_counts()`.

## Handling Missing Values:

- Identified missing values using `df.isnull().sum()` and assessed their impact on the dataset.
- Decided on an appropriate strategy to handle missing values, such as imputation or removal, based on the nature and extent of missing data.

## Visualizing the Data:

- Created various plots and visualizations to understand the distributions, relationships, and patterns within the data.
- Used histograms, box plots, and density plots to examine the distribution of numerical variables.
- Utilized bar plots, pie charts, and count plots to visualize categorical variables.
- Plotted correlation matrices or heatmaps to explore relationships between variables.
- Generated scatter plots or pair plots to visualize the interactions between multiple variables.

## Identifying Outliers:

- Detected outliers that may exist in the dataset, as they can impact the model's performance.
- Used box plots, scatter plots, or statistical techniques like Z-score or IQR (Interquartile Range) to identify and handle outliers appropriately.

## Analyzing Feature Relationships:

- Investigated the relationships between independent variables and the target variable.
- Used scatter plots, line plots, or box plots to identify trends, correlations, or dependencies.
- Computed correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson's correlation) to quantify the strength and direction of relationships.

## Feature Engineering:

- Created new features or transformed existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- Generated derived variables, performed scaling, or applied mathematical transformations based on domain knowledge.

## Addressing Data Inconsistencies and Errors:

- Identified and corrected any inconsistencies, errors, or anomalies in the data that could impact the model's performance.
- Handled erroneous values, duplicates, or data entry mistakes as necessary.

Remember, EDA is an iterative process, and I refined these steps as I gained more insights into the data. EDA helped me understand the data better, identify potential issues, and make informed decisions when preprocessing, selecting features, and building the machine learning model.

### Regression Plot:

I also plotted regression plots to check the impact of the target variable on the independent variable. These visualizations provided valuable insights into the relationships between variables and helped in understanding the predictive power of the features.
